# belly-button-challenge
In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.  

### The assignment calls for 3 main steps. 
### 1. Utilize the d3.json library to pull the metadata from the "samples.json" file and apply the necessary filter.
### 2. Using the sample data get elements such as otu_ids, out_labels, and sample_values to build a barchart and a bubble chart.
### 3. The last step is to initialize the function to run on page load. 

### Within the app.js file the steps have been commented to explain the steps that were taken for the code.

# Utilizing the Dashboard

Upon selection the static Demographic Info text box will autopopulate to show the ID number that was selected from the drop down, along with the Ethnicity, Gender, Age, Location, BBType and WFREQ. The horizontal bar graph will feature the TOP 10 Bacteria Cultures Found and the bubble chart below this will show the Bacteria Cultures per Sample.
